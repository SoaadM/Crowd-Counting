# Self Driving Car Object Detection
---


#### Data:
* A self-driving car (also known as an autonomous car or driverless car) is a vehicle that uses a different number of sensors, radars, cameras, and artificial intelligence to travel to destinations without needing a human drive.
* In this project, we trained a machine learning model to help cars to detect objects and recognition them which will help in future work to take decision based on these algorithms.

#### Question/need:
* Is the project supervised learning or unsupervise learning?
* What is the best CNN model?
* Which algorithm to use?

#### Data Description:
* The dataset contains 97,942 labels across 11 classes and 15,000 images. There are 1,720 null examples (images with no labels).

* All images are 1920x1200 (download size ~3.1 GB). We have also provided a version downsampled to 512x512 (download size ~580 MB) that is suitable for most common machine learning models (including YOLO v3, Mask R-CNN, SSD, and mobilenet).

* Annotations have been hand-checked for accuracy by Roboflow.

#### Tools:
*	Matplotlib for visualization
*	Numpy for computing 
*	Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
*	Tensorflow for machine learning and artificial intelligence
*	Sklearn, machine learning library
*	OpenCV for real-time computer vision
